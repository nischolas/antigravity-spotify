## How to Use

### 1. Get Your Spotify Data

1. Go to [Spotify Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/)
2. Request your **Extended Streaming History**
3. Wait for Spotify to email you (can take up to 30 days, but it's usually much faster)
4. Download the ZIP file from the email

### 2. Import Your Data

- **Option A**: Import the entire ZIP file directly
- **Option B**: Extract the ZIP and import individual `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json` files

### 3. View your aggregated listening data

## Important Note

> This began as a test for [Google’s Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google) and grew into a passion project. Large portions of the code are generated by an LLM under human supervision and guidance.

## Ideas / Todos

- Drag full date range slider, not just the handles
- Add a table / view as playlist in Spotify (probably not possible without a backend due to authentication and the SPA nature of this app)
- ✓ ~Single track statistics from preview player drawer~
