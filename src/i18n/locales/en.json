      {
        "question": "What data does my Extended Streaming History contain?",
        "answer": "Your Extended Streaming History contains detailed information about every single track you've played. For each of the tens of thousands of data points, it records the date and time, the song name, artist, and album. It also includes exactly how long you listened (in milliseconds!), which device you used, your location (country), and even specific details like whether you shuffled, skipped the song, or if you were listening offline. It also tracks why the song started (like clicking a row) or ended (like hitting next)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data safe?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. This app runs entirely in your browser. Your files are never imported to any server. You can even disconnect your internet after loading the page and it will still work!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my data still there even if I reload the page?",
        "answer": "Your data is stored directly in your browser. This is like a small, personal storage space just for this website. That's why your data remains even if you close the page and open it again later. You can delete it using the \"Import Different File\" button."
      },

      {
        "question": "Why do I need the \"Extended\" history?",
        "answer": "The standard \"Account Data\" download only includes the last year of listening history and lacks detailed information like \"skipped\", \"reason_start\", and \"platform\". The \"Extended Streaming History\" covers your entire account lifetime and includes all these rich details."
