        "answer": "Your Extended Streaming History contains detailed information about every single track you've played. For each of the tens of thousands of data points, it records the date and time, the song name, artist, and album. It also includes exactly how long you listened (in milliseconds!), which device you used, your location (country), and even specific details like whether you shuffled, skipped the song, or if you were listening offline. It also tracks why the song started (like clicking a row) or ended (like hitting next)."
